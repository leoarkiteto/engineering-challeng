# Build the best version you can of an online shoe shop, using React.js. Reproduce the features for the example on exercise 2, at least.

Feel free to add any other relevant features you think a shoe shop should have, or at least describe them to us.

## Remarks:

 - Mock the desired results from all backend services.
 - Cover both success and error scenarios. Feel free to use different buttons/widgets for each scenario.
 - Presentation and UX are important. We are not expecting a full professional app, but at least one that works just fine and is easy to use.
